# text-adventure-engine-js
text adventure engine in javascript


# ISSUES

- text wrap
- talking sound cuts in and out


# FEATURES TO ADD

- inventory section


# TO DO

- Refactor a lot, add more comments to style and script files.
- split up js files
- there's a problem with animation, like the toilet is forced to animate here.
- what if I want the toilet to animate right away?
- different approach to text animation (load the text into window, and change each from hidden to show.)
- I may have to do a "queState" I don't like how the states are managed, like how the manager says his last line.
- yeah the state management doesn't make sense, it should be more like levels?
- also I would have preferred if I could have different tones for talking characters
